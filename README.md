## Development of REST based Web API with .NET Version 9 using ASP.NET MVC Framework. 
The basic 4-step process for designing a RESTful web API is to first identify and define the resources you want to expose, such as users or products. Next, decide how those resources will be represented, usually in formats like JSON or XML. Then, design clear and meaningful endpoints using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to operate on those resources. Finally, implement proper request handling and ensure your API is well-documented and easy to test so others can use it effectively
To build a REST Web API with ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio using .NET 9, simply create a new Web API project, define your endpoints in controllers, and run the projectâ€”which includes built-in tools like Swagger for testing, while in Java we need Springboot and Postman Testing for complete process.
